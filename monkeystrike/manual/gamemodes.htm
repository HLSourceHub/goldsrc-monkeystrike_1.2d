In the first release of Monkeystrike you will be able to play 3 different
gamemodes.<br>
Check out the descriptions below for more information about them.<br><br><br>

<b><u>Deathmatch:</u></b><br><br>
Monkey versus monkey. No teams, just pure deathmatch. Weapons come with the
classes you pick before joining the match. The player with the most points wins.<br><br>
Before joining the match, you will have to pick a class you
would like to fight with. An image of the class, its weapons and attributes will
appear when you hover above the class' name. Simply choose your class by
clicking on the name. You can switch to another class at any point during the
game, by pressing the &quot;classmenu&quot; button.<br><br><br>

<u>&quot;Deathmatch&quot; score system:</u><br><br>
Frag - 10 points<br>
Headshot - 20 points<br>
Frags/Headshots count twice if the player is in bonustime ( bonustime icon ).<br>
The prefix &quot;ms_&quot; before the map title indicates that it is a &quot;Deathmatch&quot;
map.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<b><u>Capture the Golden Banana:</u></b><br><br>
This is a team based gamemode, therefore you will have to join a team
before you can choose your class.<br><br>
In &quot;Capture the Golden Banana&quot; and &quot;Fruity Sacrifice&quot; you
will have to choose the team you would like to join before proceeding to the
class menu. Click on the team's name for choosing or click on &quot;Spectators&quot;
if you prefer to observe the match.<br><br><br>

A golden banana is located in the middle of the map and both teams try to
capture it in the <u>hostile</u> base. After capturing the banana or dropping it (by dying) it will respawn
at its original location after a small delay.<br><br><br>
<u>&quot;Capture the Golden Banana&quot; score system:</u><br><br>
Frag - 10<br>
Headshot - 20<br>
&quot;Banana capture&quot; - 100<br>
The prefix &quot;ctb_&quot; before the map title indicates that it is a &quot;Capture the Golden Banana&quot; map.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<b><u>Fruity Sacrifice:</u></b><br><br>
This gamemode is also team based. In &quot;Fruity Sacrifice&quot; several
fruits are spread over the level and both teams try to grab the fruits and bring
them to their &quot;sacrifice point&quot; to score.<br>
If a monkey gets killed he loses all the fruits he collected. The limit of
fruits a player can carry is 3.<br>
You can steal fruits from the opponent sacrifice point, so make sure
that <u>your</u> fruits stay <u>your</u> fruits once you have brought them to your
sacrifice point.<br><br><br>
<u>&quot;Fruity Sacrifice&quot; score system:</u><br><br>
Frag - 10<br>
Headshot - 20<br>
Fruit capture - 0<br>
Different from the other two gamemodes the team score cannot be raised by frags
in &quot;Fruity Sacrifice&quot;. The team score is representing the current number
of fruits in your team's sacrifice point.<br><br><br>
The prefix &quot;fs_&quot; before the map title indicates that it is a &quot;Fruity
Sacrifice&quot; map.
